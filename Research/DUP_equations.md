# 🪐 Interpreting the DUP Equations

## 1. Coherence Law (C)
Wave-based simulation using real sensor data or stochastic proxy. Entangled simulations across all reference frames and realities with time sweep (Aurora Twins).

## 2. Recursive Scaling (Sn)
Iterative scripts in Simfold/IpAI, analyzing chaos, attractors, and stability across tens of thousands of paths.

## 3. Macroscopic Entanglement (M)
Quantum tensor network engine parallelizes summations, applies Monte Carlo + FFT, and TensorFlow for data-heavy studies.

## Invisible Pressure Theory: A Technical Blueprint for Reality

### Universal Basis: Invisible Pressure Field, Resonance, & Coherence
There exists a continuous, universal invisible pressure field (IPF), whose resonance structure at frequencies like 7.83 Hz (the Schumann fundamental) shapes atomic, molecular, and even cosmic phenomena.

### Fundamental Law
The oscillatory amplitude \( P(x, t) = A_0 e^{i 2\pi f t + \phi(x)} \), where \( f \) = 7.83 Hz for the first Earth mode.
